# AOC2022
These are my Python solutions for Advent of Code 2022. I'm using AOC to become more familiar with Python, having seen/edited/debugged lots of Python code but written relatively little from scratch.

Naming convention is AOC<day><part>.py for source and input<day>.txt for input files. If there isn't a separate part a and b, I combined the two solutions into part b.
